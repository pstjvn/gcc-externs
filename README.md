Provides the externs used in my projects.

_The following projects are included currently:_

  - models for material elements
  - nesting of material elements
- chrome.cast API - auto generated from the docs found on: https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/reference/chrome/

Additional externs will be included as the project goes.
